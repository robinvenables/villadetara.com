We first saw Villa de Tara in October 2020 after our first attempt at house-hunting in Crete was halted by the COVID-19 Delta variant. Although it wasn't our first choice, we were unable to agree a deal for our preferred property and quickly moved for this one.

On reflection, Villa de Tara offers us a much better option in terms of house layout, location and access to local services. The property finally became ours back in May this year and we are now looking forward to planning our future here. We invite you to join us for the journey ahead.
